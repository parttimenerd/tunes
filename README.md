Tunes
=====
Simple games that require you to play specific notes with an instrument in front of your computer.
It then uses the WebAudio API and the [teoria](https://github.com/saebekassebil/teoria) library to check whether you
actually played the right tone.

It helps learning the playing of notes and using intervals.

The game is tested with the ukulele and the keyboard.
